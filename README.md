The following is a list of Real-Time audio processing Libraries which can be used:

1) Aubio : C based collection of libraries, implementing algorithms for pitch detection, beat detection, onset detection, silence detection, etc.
Implements digital filters, can work in real time. interesting because it detects and tracks musical aspects from a real time audio input. Accessible from python.

2) Synthesis toolkit:  C++ package containing a variety of sound and music synthesis functions, as well as filters, envelope detectors, etc. 

3) Pyo : Python module written in C for DSP script creation. Contains classes for various filters, like biquad, LPF, HPF, etc. 
Contains many other audio signal analysis tools.

4) SigLib: Based on C. Not open source, but a free evaluation version available. contains various filters and tools relating to a lot of engineering applications. Looks like a mature and well developed library. Supports real-time
